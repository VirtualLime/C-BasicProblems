#Problem 1:

Given a string of words (x), you need to return an array of the words, sorted alphabetically by the final character in each.

If two words have the same last letter, they returned array should show them in the order they appeared in the given string.

All inputs will be valid.

#Problem 2:

Given an array arr of strings, complete the function by calculating the total perimeter of all the islands. Each piece of land will be marked with 'X' while the water fields are represented as 'O'. Consider each tile being a perfect 1 x 1 piece of land. Some examples for better visualization:

['XOOXO',
 'XOOXO',
 'OOOXO',
 'XXOXO',
 'OXOOO'] 
which represents:

should return: "Total land perimeter: 24".

Following input:

['XOOO',
 'XOXO',
 'XOXO',
 'OOXX',
 'OOOO']
which represents:

should return: "Total land perimeter: 18"


#Problem 3:

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

Examples
"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"

"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"

"The_Stealth-Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"

#Problem 4:

A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcissistic:

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

    1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938
The Challenge:

Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.

This may be True and False in your language, e.g. PHP.

Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be passed into the function.

#Problem 5

Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

Examples
Kata.Maskify("4556364607935616"); // should return "############5616"
Kata.Maskify("64607935616");      // should return "#######5616"
Kata.Maskify("1");                // should return "1"
Kata.Maskify("");                 // should return ""

// "What was the name of your first pet?"
Kata.Maskify("Skippy");                                   // should return "##ippy"
Kata.Maskify("Nananananananananananananananana Batman!"); // should return "####################################man!"

#Problem 6

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

#Problem 7

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

Examples
Kata.PigIt("Pig latin is cool"); // igPay atinlay siay oolcay
Kata.PigIt("Hello world !");     // elloHay orldway !

#Problem 8

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

Examples
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 
Notes
Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!

#Problem 9

You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).

#Problem 10

Build Tower
Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "*" character.

For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:

[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]


#Problem 11

Task
You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

Examples
[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]

#Problem 12

A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either

individual integers
or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example "12,13,15-17"
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.

Example:

solution([-10, -9, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20]);
// returns "-10--8,-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20"
